# WEATHER APP (Asynchronous Node.js)

In this project we are creating an Asynchronous Non Blocking Node.js application.
It means that the application will continue to do other things while waiting for a long run io process to complete.

We are going to explore async programming with a basic example 
And based off of that example we will build a basic weather application.
To build that application, we are going to  interact with real time weather API and that will require us to make an async HTTP requests.

## First thing first
We don't need to initialize the app using npm init
We are just going to place a bunch of console.log calls
